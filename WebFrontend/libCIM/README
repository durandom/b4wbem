				libCIM
				======


libCIM is a collection of Perl modules that are essential for the
implementation of the Common Information Model (CIM).

Try `perldoc lib/CIM.pm'  for some technical informations. 
(Not yet complete!)

See the file COPYING for copyright and warranty information.

See the file lib/CIM.pm for version number.


Requirements
------------

For libCIM to work you need some non standard Perl modules: 
ANSIColor
Carp-Assert
DateManip
Digest-MD5
File-PathConvert
HTML-Parser
MIME-Base64
Parse-Yapp
Tie-SecureHash
URI
XML-Parser
XML-Simple
libnet
libwww-perl
libxml-enno
libxml-perl

You can get them from CPAN or from ftp://ftp.id-pro.de/pub/CIM/Perl-Modules.
If you get them from the ID-PRO ftp server, please take a look 
at the README at the same place.



Installation
------------

To configure, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following

        perl Makefile.PL

Then to build you run make.

        make

You can then test the module by typing:

        make test

If you have write access to the Perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

        make install

For use with PaulA, you don't necessarily have to install libCIM into
the system. See the file README in the PaulA package for details.



What you will find in the subdirectories:
-----------------------------------------

t/
	Test scripts

etc/
	Useful stuff like templates for POD and the Perl modules test
	scripts and a coding styleguide.

lib/
	Leads to the modules. The only module you find here is CIM.pm,
	which is mainly for documentation purposes and maintaining
	the version number.

lib/CIM/
	The main library location.
	Here you find a couple of Perl modules.

	The Transport/ subdirectory contains classes which deal with
	the transport of CIM requests/responses.



What you will _not_ find in the subdirectories:
-----------------------------------------------

- executables
- XML-CIM-Class-declarations
- Providers

and (last but not least):

- the CIM Object Manager (cimom)

Such things are located in the "PaulA" package, which depends on libCIM.
