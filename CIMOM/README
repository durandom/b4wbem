				PaulA
				=====


PaulA intends to be an administration system for Linux. It is based on
libCIM, which serves as a basis for an implementation of the
Common Information Model (CIM). In particular, PaulA offers a
CIM Object Manager (cimom), and a sample CIM Client. 

See README.PaulA for using instructions.

Try `perldoc lib/PaulA.pm' for some technical informations.

See the file COPYING for copyright and warranty information.

See the file lib/PaulA.pm for version number.

Requirements
------------

First of all, you need libCIM. Get and install the latest version of it.
You find it at the same place you found this package ;-)
If you don't want to (or can't) install libCIM into the system,
you can place it parallel to the PaulA package, and everything will
work "out of the box".
The only thing you have to do in this case is to create two links 
"libCIM" resp. "PaulA" pointing to the "libCIM-[version]" resp. 
"PaulA-[version]" directory, 


You will need a apache with mod_perl support. Copy the httpd executable
to /usr/sbin/cimom or change the <httpd> configuration variable in
the cimserver.xml configuration file.

Besides libCIM you need some other non standard Perl modules.
We have mentioned this in the README of the libCIM package.
Please take a look at it, if you haven't done this already.

Furthermore, you need a properly installed nsgmls. It's included in
either of the RPMs "jade" (Red Hat) and "sp" (Debian and SuSE).



Configuration
-------------

To configure, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr

Then to build you run make.

        make

You can then test the module by typing:

        make test

You can install by either simply typing:

        make install

or to install to a different location:

	make install INSTALLPREFIX=/some/where/in/space

Furthermore, all files in t/system/orig are copied to t/system.
These are "pseudo system files", which are treated by the providers.
If you play with the providers and want to begin from scratch at some
point, just do a `make config', and the original files are copied again.
 


What you will find in the subdirectories:
-----------------------------------------

t/
	Test scripts

t/system/
	The location were the test providers expect the "system files"
	to be.	

t/system/orig/
	Pseudo "system files" for provider testing. They are copied
	to t/system during make.

bin/
	Contains the cimom, and a test CIM Client. 
	See README.PaulA for details

etc/
	Currently no file from CVS. But while "make" a cimom 
	configuration file will be created in this directory 
	for later usage

etc/templates/
	Template file for automatic generation of a CIMOM config file. 
	Needed by config.PL, which is called during `make'.

lib/PaulA/
	The main library location.
	Here you find a couple of Perl modules.

repository/
	CIMOM's repository :)
