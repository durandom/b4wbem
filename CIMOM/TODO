This is a list over things that we plan to implement in PaulA. 
The order of items does not reflect priority.
A more or less extensive discussion follows after the list.


o a lot of Provider things (including an up-to-date documentation)

o Association Support

o better Extrinsic Methods support

o better Provider support (currently hardly in developement)
  [a special ToDo list for Provider you will find in TODO.Provider]

o Providing a repository database (instead of simple files)

o More and better tests

o More and better documentation


(Far) Future Features
======================
(ideas for features which won't be implemented in the short run)

o tests for given configurations 
  (eg. testing your fetchmail configuration without danger of bouncing
  mails)
  automatic (after every change)? on demand?

Small Things
============
This is a list of annoying, but harmless bugs
* Make apache/cimom use the system wide mime.types file
* Make everything installable at a given PREFIX

Discussion
==========

nothing to discuss at the moment ;-)
