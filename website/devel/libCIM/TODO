This is a list over things that we plan to implement in libCIM.
The order of items does not reflect priority.
A more or less extensive discussion follows after the list.


o Move closer to specification (HTTP headers, HTTP/1.1, M-POST, ...)

o way better Association support

o More tests

o More and better documentation

o CIM::Value::value() returns in case of $isArray an array, not an array
  reference. The day by day working showed that the latter case is quite
  comfortable. We wrote the temporarily function valueAsRef() instead.

nothing to discuss at the moment ;-)
