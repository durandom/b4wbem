The key to understand what we are doing is to understand the
Common Information Model (CIM). CIM is a conceptual information model
for describing management that is not bound to a particular implementation.



For further informations, try the <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/spec/cimfaq.html#what">CIM FAQ</a>, and the <a href="links.html">links</a> section.

<h3 align="left"><font color="#00378a">libCIM - Definition and features</font></h3>
<ul>
      <li>libCIM is a collection of Perl modules</li>
      <li>It serves as a basis for an implementation of the CIM</li>
      <li>It provides classes which "mirror" corresponding CIM entities
(such as <tt>CIM::Class, CIM::Instance</tt>)</li>
      <li>It provides an API for use in CIM Clients</li>
      <li>Licence: GPL</li>
    </ul>


<h3 align="left"><font color="#00378a">PaulA - Definition and features</font></h3>
<ul>
      <li>PaulA intends to be a (lib)CIM-based administration system for Linux</li>
      <li>It's written in Perl (of course)</li>
      <li>It provides a (very basic) CIM Object Manager (CIMOM)</li>
      <li>It provides a sample CIM Client for testing purposes</li>
      <li>It provides a repository to store "static" CIM entities</li>
      <li>The CIMOM has the ability to communicate with Providers, which
supply "dynamic" CIM entities</li>
      <li>PaulA doesn't depend on a special distribution,
'cause the Providers have the "knowlegde" about the underlying Linux,
and they can be exchanged</li>
      <li>Licence: GPL</li>
    </ul>
